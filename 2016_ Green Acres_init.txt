She must now take this opportunity to unify the party and satisfy the disgruntled Progressives. <b>John Kasich</b>, the Governor of Ohio, has won the Republican nomination and plans to run an upbeat, Optimistic campaign. If he can satisfy Conservatives and moderates, it may work out. <i>Many Voters have been feeling dissatisfied with their choices this campaign, but of Course, it's not like they have a third Choice?</i></p>",

Over 10 years later, Donald Trump has returned spiritually awakened, mastering how to art on how to live off the earth, and he has returned with a vengeance.\n</p>\n<p>Angered by the Democratic Establishment and the Obama administration for being too moderate and underdelivering, Trump has entered National Politics under the Green Party, easily dethroning Jill Stein from her party in the primary. Trump is ready to run the most Progressive campaign ever and hopes to gain the support of 'Bernie Bros' who wanted change but instead got Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, it will be an uphill battle to convince the public that a former Billionaire wanting Billionaires to be taxed more isn't silly.</p>",
